## This is the git tutorial.

# GIT
- version control system
- helps you keep track of code changes
- used to collaborate on code

```

git version 2.30.2.windows.1
```

# Git and Remote Repositories
- Git and GitHub are different things
- While Git is a version control system, GitHub is a platform that uses Git to provide additional features for collaborative development
- Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes
- GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It provides a user-friendly interface and additional features for collaborative development, such as issue tracking, project management, and code review

# What is Git?
- popular version control system
- created by Linus Torvalds in 2005
- maintained by Junio Hamano since then

# Used for:
- Tracking code changes
- Tracking who made changes
- Coding collaboration

# What does got do?
- Manage projects with Repositories
- Clone a project to work on a local copy
- Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
- Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
- Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
- Push local updates to the main project

# Working with Git
- Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
- Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
- When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
- You select the modified files you want to Stage
- The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
- Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
- You can revert back to any previous commit.
- Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!
